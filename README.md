# Analyzing supplementary videos

I lecture a first year engineering course and during the semester I created 80 supplementary videos
for the course that the students could watch in their own time.  I was interested to see how the videos
affected the final semester grades.

To do this, I utilized machine learning, specifically feature selection, to identify which of the 80 videos (features) had the
strongest association with the target final semester grades.  

##  Data
The data set is called FYMarksMinute2.csv.  There are 80 features, each representing the watch time for a different video.  The target is the final year grades for each student.  And finally, there are 712 students (observations).
